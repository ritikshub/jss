-> Docker Compose lets you run Redis for BullMQ easily by defining a service that uses the official redis:7 image
-> gives the container a fixed name
-> enables AOF persistence for safer queue operations
-> exposes port 6379 so your Node.js app can connect
-> mounts a persistent volume to store Redis data even after restarts. 
-> The restart: unless-stopped policy ensures Redis auto-restores on crashes or system reboot.
-> You run everything using docker compose up -d, stop it with docker compose down, and remove both containers and stored data using docker compose down -v.
